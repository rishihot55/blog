Hi! I am Rishi Rajasekaran.

I am (hopefully) a graduate of Computer Science and Engineering from NIT Trichy who currently lives in Chennai. I am interested in coding, quizzing, word games and food. I was a Web Developer at the Spider R&D Club of NIT Trichy and a member of Balls by Picasso, the Literary and Debating Society of NIT Trichy.

This blog is my attempt to document the various things that I'm interested in. It's initially gonna be mostly coding related, but I'll probably add more stuff on Quizzing and Word Games if people are interested in it. Since this blog is quite new, I'll be making a lot more changes and improving the UI beyond the silly Jekyll theme later.
