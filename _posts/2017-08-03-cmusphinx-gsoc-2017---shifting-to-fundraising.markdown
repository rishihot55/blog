Hello everyone! Here's the update that I was hinting at in the previous post. As part of the data collection task, we require the collection of a large number of transcripts and recordings through Amazon Mechanical Turk.  We are looking at targeting at least fifty thousand transcriptions of more than a thousand phrases. To meet that goal, we'll require around 25,000$ for sustaining the data collection run. The recordings and transcriptions that we obtain through this will be shared in the open domain.

I'll be helping build a fundraising platform along with [Saurabh Singh](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~saurabh.singh/), a fellow GSoCer who is working on this as his main project. As a part of this, we're working on a Flask Web Application to elucidate on the goals of this project and to help us reach potential donors who can help support this initiative. If you'd like to help contribute, please reach out to me or my mentor [James](http://talknicer.com/). The more help we get, the faster we can work in achieving the goals of this project.

Here's a sneak peek of the site that we're working on as of now.

The repository for the fundraising application can be found [here](https://github.com/saurabhima/gsoc_LEADERBOARD). We'll be deploying this application sometime in the coming week on the Wikimedia Labs Tool Servers platform and start our campaign to raise money for the project. I'll be detailing the progress that we've done so far in the coming posts so that you'll get a better insight of what this application all about.
